         <h2>AI</h2>
         <img src="ai2.jpg">
         <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It involves the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, reasoning, perception, and natural language understanding.</p><br>
         <p><h3>Applications of AI:</h3>
            Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
            Self-driving cars
            Fraud detection in banking
            Healthcare diagnostics
            AI image and video generation (like your project!)</p>

        <h2>ML</h2>
       <img src="ml.webp">
       
       <p>ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves using algorithms and statistical models to analyze patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.</p>
       <p><h3>Common ML Applications:</h3>
        Image and speech recognition
        Recommendation systems
        Fraud detection
        Natural language processing (NLP)
        Autonomous systems (self-driving cars, robotics)</p>

    <h2>DL</h2>
    <img src="Deep-learning.png">
    <p>Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks to model complex patterns and relationships in data. It is inspired by the structure of the human brain and excels in tasks involving large-scale data, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.</p>
    <p><h3>Applications of Deep Learning:</h3>
        Computer Vision (image classification, medical imaging)
        Natural Language Processing (chatbots, translation)
        Speech Recognition (Siri, Alexa)
        Autonomous Vehicles (self-driving cars)
        Generative AI (AI art, deepfake technology)</p>
